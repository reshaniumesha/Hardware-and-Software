<h3 align="left"><font face="Arial"color="Navy">What is Software?</font face></h3>
<ul type="circle">
<li> Software is a collection of instructions that can be ‘run’ on a computer. These instructions tell the computer what to do. </li><br>
<li> Software is not a physical thing (but it can of course be stored on a physical medium such as a CD-ROM), it is just a bunch of codes.</li><br>
<li> For a computer system to be useful it has to consist of both hardware and software.</li>
